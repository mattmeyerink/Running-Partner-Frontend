# Running Partner Frontend
This is the front end for the Running Partner application. Data is at the heart of any good distance training plan. This product has the goal of placing a runner's training plans and training journal in one place for future planning alongside past analysis. 

### About the Technology
This front end is build using React.js interacting with the Python-Flask backend. It is hosted on a heroku server. Currently the address is the default heroku namespace for the app (https://run-partner.herokuapp.com/).

Note that if the site is not loading properly it may be down for maintenance as we are currently in the process of developing the platform to the highest standards for our users!
